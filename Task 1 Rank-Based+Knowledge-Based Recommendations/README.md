## Movie Recommendations System (Rank and Knowledge base) 

### Dataset Overview
The code works with two datasets: `movies` and `reviews`. The `movies` dataset contains information about movies, including movie ID, title, genre, release date, and genre-specific columns. The `reviews` dataset contains user reviews with details such as user ID, movie ID, rating, timestamp, and date.

### Data Preprocessing

#### Reviews Dataset
1. **Data Overview**: The `reviews` dataset has 712,337 entries and 23 columns.
2. **Data Types**: The dataset contains user ratings, timestamps, and date information.
3. **Rating Statistics**: Descriptive statistics for the 'rating' column are provided, showing count, mean, standard deviation, and quartiles.
4. **Timestamp Conversion**: The 'date' column is converted to a datetime format.

#### Movies Dataset
1. **Data Overview**: The `movies` dataset consists of 31,245 entries and 35 columns.
2. **Data Types**: The dataset includes movie details, release dates, and genre-specific columns.
3. **Missing Values**: There are 223 missing values in the 'genre' column, which are subsequently dropped.

### Movie Recommendations

#### Task Description
The primary task of the code is to generate a list of movie recommendations based on popularity.

#### Popularity Criteria
1. **Average Rating**: Movies with the highest average rating are considered best.
2. **Rating Frequency**: In case of ties in average rating, movies with more ratings are ranked higher.
3. **Minimum Ratings**: Movies must have a minimum of 5 ratings to be considered.
4. **Recent Ratings**: If tied in average rating and rating frequency, the ranking is determined by the most recent rating.

#### Implementation
1. **Average Rating Calculation**: The code calculates the average rating for each movie.
2. **Rating Frequency Calculation**: The code determines the frequency of ratings for each movie.
3. **Filtering Popular Movies**: Movies with less than 5 ratings are filtered out.
4. **Sorting Recommendations**: Recommendations are sorted based on average rating, rating frequency, and recency.

### Future Steps
1. The code lays the foundation for building a movie recommendation system.
2. Further steps may include incorporating collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, or hybrid approaches for personalized recommendations.

### Conclusion
The provided code addresses the initial steps of creating a movie recommendation system based on popularity. It focuses on data preprocessing and establishing a framework for future recommendation algorithms.
